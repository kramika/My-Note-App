# My-Note-App
The app is simple and easy to operate. It contains a list of notes assigning each note with its respective title. The note can be added by tapping on the ‘plus’ icon. The added notes can further be updated and deleted by swiping left and right respectively. Used MVVM, Recycler view and Room for its implementation.
